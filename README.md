# Description
A windows form application that queried the digital river stock endpoint for RTX 30XX cards. 

This application was written at a time where 'clean' focused code 
wasn't nessecarily a priority for me, the only reason it still remains as a repository is for archival purposes and to demonstrate how my programming ability
has changed.

# What did this application do?
This was written when myself and others were attempting to obtain the RTX 30XX Graphics cards. Stock was released in EXTREMELY small amounts and at seemingly random times.
It surfaced on the Nvidia subreddit that there was a public API (https://in-and-ru-store-api.uk-e1.cloudhub.io/DR/get-inventory/en_gb/5438792800?format=json&expand=availablequantity) that displayed
the stock information for the RTX series of cards. Whilst it didn't give a certain indicator stock was about to drop, it did serve as an early warning that quantities had increased.

# Improvements
There are no further planned improvements as this application is no longer being developed.
